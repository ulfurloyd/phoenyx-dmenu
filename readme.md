## my build of dmenu, the app launcher that sucks less
- `dmenu` is a dynamic menu for X, originally designed for `dwm`. It manages large numbers of user-defined menu items efficiently.
- configured entirely through modifying the source code, `dmenu` is a perfect complement to `dwm`.

## patches
- alpha
    - allows transparency
- border
    - adds a window border around the menu
- caseinsensitive
    - makes case insensitivity the default
- center
    - spawns the window in the center of the display, horizontally
- fuzzymatch
    - allows fuzzy searching
- fuzzyhighlight
    - highlights the fuzzy searches from `fuzzymatch`
- numbers
    - prints [results/total] next to the search field
